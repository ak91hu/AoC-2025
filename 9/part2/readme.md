# TASK

--- Day 9: Movie Theater ---
You slide down the firepole in the corner of the playground and land in the North Pole base movie theater!

The movie theater has a big tile floor with an interesting pattern. Elves here are redecorating the theater by switching out some of the square tiles in the big grid they form. Some of the tiles are red; the Elves would like to find the largest rectangle that uses red tiles for two of its opposite corners. They even have a list of where the red tiles are located in the grid (your puzzle input).

For example:

7,1
11,1
11,7
9,7
9,5
2,5
2,3
7,3
Showing red tiles as # and other tiles as ., the above arrangement of red tiles would look like this:

..............
.......#...#..
..............
..#....#......
..............
..#......#....
..............
.........#.#..
..............
You can choose any two red tiles as the opposite corners of your rectangle; your goal is to find the largest rectangle possible.

For example, you could make a rectangle (shown as O) with an area of 24 between 2,5 and 9,7:

..............
.......#...#..
..............
..#....#......
..............
..OOOOOOOO....
..OOOOOOOO....
..OOOOOOOO.#..
..............
Or, you could make a rectangle with area 35 between 7,1 and 11,7:

..............
.......OOOOO..
.......OOOOO..
..#....OOOOO..
.......OOOOO..
..#....OOOOO..
.......OOOOO..
.......OOOOO..
..............
You could even make a thin rectangle with an area of only 6 between 7,3 and 2,3:

..............
.......#...#..
..............
..OOOOOO......
..............
..#......#....
..............
.........#.#..
..............
Ultimately, the largest rectangle you can make in this example has area 50. One way to do this is between 2,5 and 11,1:

..............
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..OOOOOOOOOO..
..............
.........#.#..
..............
Using two red tiles as opposite corners, what is the largest area of any rectangle you can make?

--- Part Two ---
The Elves just remembered: they can only switch out tiles that are red or green. So, your rectangle can only include red or green tiles.

In your list, every red tile is connected to the red tile before and after it by a straight line of green tiles. The list wraps, so the first red tile is also connected to the last red tile. Tiles that are adjacent in your list will always be on either the same row or the same column.

Using the same example as before, the tiles marked X would be green:

..............
.......#XXX#..
.......X...X..
..#XXXX#...X..
..X........X..
..#XXXXXX#.X..
.........X.X..
.........#X#..
..............
In addition, all of the tiles inside this loop of red and green tiles are also green. So, in this example, these are the green tiles:

..............
.......#XXX#..
.......XXXXX..
..#XXXX#XXXX..
..XXXXXXXXXX..
..#XXXXXX#XX..
.........XXX..
.........#X#..
..............
The remaining tiles are never red nor green.

The rectangle you choose still must have red tiles in opposite corners, but any other tiles it includes must now be red or green. This significantly limits your options.

For example, you could make a rectangle out of red and green tiles with an area of 15 between 7,3 and 11,1:

..............
.......OOOOO..
.......OOOOO..
..#XXXXOOOOO..
..XXXXXXXXXX..
..#XXXXXX#XX..
.........XXX..
.........#X#..
..............
Or, you could make a thin rectangle with an area of 3 between 9,7 and 9,5:

..............
.......#XXX#..
.......XXXXX..
..#XXXX#XXXX..
..XXXXXXXXXX..
..#XXXXXXOXX..
.........OXX..
.........OX#..
..............
The largest rectangle you can make in this example using only red and green tiles has area 24. One way to do this is between 9,5 and 2,3:

..............
.......#XXX#..
.......XXXXX..
..OOOOOOOOXX..
..OOOOOOOOXX..
..OOOOOOOOXX..
.........XXX..
.........#X#..
..............
Using two red tiles as opposite corners, what is the largest area of any rectangle you can make using only red and green tiles?

# SOLUTION
he problem required finding the largest rectangular area defined by two red tile corners that fits entirely within a rectilinear polygon formed by red and green tiles. The solution began by parsing the provided coordinates to establish the vertices of this complex, closed shape. To find the optimal solution efficiently, the script generated every possible rectangle by pairing all unique red tile coordinates and then calculated their potential areas. These candidate rectangles were immediately sorted in descending order of size so that the algorithm could stop as soon as a valid answer was found.

The core of the solution relied on a strict geometric validation process to ensure each candidate rectangle was strictly contained within the polygon's boundaries. This validation first checked that the two implied corners of the rectangle, as well as its precise center point, lay inside the polygon using a ray-casting algorithm. Crucially, the code also verified that none of the polygon's edges sliced through the interior of the rectangle, which would violate the "red and green tiles only" rule. The first rectangle to pass all these geometric tests was identified as the solution, yielding a maximum valid area of 1,571,016,172.
