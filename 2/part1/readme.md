This Python script purpose is to identify corrupted product IDs within a North Pole gift shop database. The core logic identifies "invalid" IDs as numbers formed by a strictly repeated sequence of digits, such as 3434 or 123123. Given a complex input of numerical ranges, the solution efficiently filters for these specific patterns rather than brute-forcing every possible number. The algorithm generates candidate IDs from base seeds (e.g., seed 12 becomes 1212) and verifies their existence within the specified ranges to minimize processing time. Finally, the script calculates and outputs the total sum of all detected invalid IDs to complete the database audit.
